# Module 11: Express.JS Note Taker

## Description

This is a simple little app that lets you take notes, save them, and delete them. 

## Usage

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Lessons Learned
- path.join() is a module that needs to be imported from node
- Use .push() to append additional objects onto a JSON array
- npm modules all have their own formatting and function parameters. Skimming over the documentation can lead to very confusing errors, like ```SyntaxError: Unexpected token t in JSON at position 3``` because your readFile callback function takes (err, data) as parameters, not just (data)
