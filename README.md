# Module 11: Express.JS Note Taker

## Description

This is a simple little app that lets you take notes, save them, and delete them. 

## Usage

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Lessons Learned
- Even if something is integrated into node, it often still needs to be imported to be used (path, fs, etc)
- npm modules all have their own formatting and function parameters. Skimming over the documentation can lead to very confusing errors, like ```SyntaxError: Unexpected token t in JSON at position 3``` because your readFile callback function takes (err, data) as parameters, not just (data)
